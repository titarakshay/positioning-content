            <div class="red-div">Notice the space between them.
                    It occurs because of my carriage in return HTML which I have used to keep the code organized.
                    I have used to reset to insure no elements  should have any default margin or padding.
                    (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.)
                    This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements.

                <div class="green-div">These two divs are positioned using <span class="highlight">float:left</span></div>
                <div class="green-div">You can see that , even though the elements are spaced in the code,
                    the space is not actually rendered on the page.This may not be a huge deal in this first examples..

                What if I want my side-side elements to take up the full width of parent element?
                I can set the width of each to 50%, right?
            </div>
            <div class="bottom red-div">
                    Wrong!Because,together,the two inline block will add up to 100% of the available width.
                    but that doesn't account for the space between.

                    (which, in case,is the same as widthof the viewport.)
